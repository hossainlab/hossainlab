## **Bio**

I am a biomedical researcher focusing on neuroepidemiology, cancer epidemiology, and cancer bioinformatics. My primary interest lies in applying machine learning algorithms to health data including electronic health records, multi-omics big data, and neurological images. I aim to optimize clinically actionable biomarkers and develop predictive models to enable early diagnosis and treatment for neurological disorders and cancer. Furthermore, I am interested in visualizing these data and models to facilitate biological interpretation and clinical applications.

I am currently the Founder and Executive Director of [CHIRAL Bangladesh](). My leadership extends to [aiHealth Lab]() and [Big Bioinformatics Lab](), where the focus is on advancing cancer bioinformatics and artificial intelligence for health. As an educator, I hold the position of Lead Instructor and Organizer at the Training Unit of CHIRAL. Additionally, I serve as an instructor for the Data Science for Biologists program at cBLAST.
