Hi thereðŸ‘‹ <br> 
Currently, I am working as an intern at the Health System and Population Studies Division, [icddr,b](icddrb.org/). I am the founder of [CHIRAL Bangladesh](https://chiralbd.org/), a non-profit organization dedicated to health research to improve lives in Bangladesh. I graduated from the Department of Microbiology at Jagannath University Dhaka.
